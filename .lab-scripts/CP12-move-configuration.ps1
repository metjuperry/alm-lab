#
# Reference data (e.g. warehouse locations) must travel with the app, not be re-keyed per
# environment. The Configuration Migration Tool (CMT) via txc moves records the same way
# solutions move metadata - and just like metadata, the records themselves can be SOURCE:
# an authored data.xml with stable GUIDs that any environment imports identically.
#
# The flow, all from source control:
#   1. Author the CMT package (schema + seed records + OPC manifest) beside the Package
#      Deployer - records as code, reviewable in a PR (scaffold/13-config-data.ps1).
#   2. Import it into Dev - the app instantly has data to work with.
#   3. Round-trip: export from Dev back into the same package - any records you added
#      by hand in the maker portal get captured as source (the data twin of
#      'txc env solution pull' from CP10).
#   4. Import into Test - config stays consistent across environments; in CI the package
#      deploys alongside the solutions.

Package warehouse reference data so environments stay consistent as the app moves through ALM stages. The CMT package is authored as source (seed records with stable GUIDs), imported into Dev, round-tripped back from Dev, and imported into Test.

## Changes
- add src/Packages.Main/Data/data_schema.xml covering the four warehouse tables (including Product)
- add src/Packages.Main/Data/data.xml with seed locations, products, items, and transactions
  (Wireless Mouse is pre-linked to a seeded Nutella product record)
- add the [Content_Types].xml OPC manifest required by the CMT package format
- import the package into Dev and Test; export captures manual Dev records as source
- pause after the Dev import so you can run the Warehouse Picking code app locally
  (npm run dev) against real seeded data — pick from Office Laptop (qty 100, succeeds)
  and try over-picking Wireless Mouse (qty 5, fails with the live plugin validation
  error surfaced as a toast)
## Testing
- txc data package import and export complete successfully against Dev and Test
- code app npm run dev against Dev shows real items/locations, a successful pick updates
  quantity live, and an over-pick on Wireless Mouse surfaces the plugin's rejection message
