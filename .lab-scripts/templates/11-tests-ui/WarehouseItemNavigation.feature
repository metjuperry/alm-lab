Feature: Warehouse Item Navigation

Scenario: User can open a warehouse item from the main view
    Given I am logged in as 'a warehouse manager'
    And I open the '__PREFIX___warehouseapp' app
    When I click on 'Warehouse Items' in the sitemap
    Then I should see the 'Active Warehouse Items' view
