# ╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
#
# Conceptually this is step ONE of the BDD-agent authoring chain: give an agent a prompt,
# it explores the running app, and it hands back .feature files. It's checkpoint 15, not
# checkpoint 1, because that agent needs something to reuse - the frozen step-binding
# catalog under src/Tests.UI/Support/Bindings/ that CP13 scaffolds. Without that catalog
# the agent has nothing to check its own scenarios against and will happily invent steps
# nobody can execute. So: build the bindings first (CP13), plan against them from here on.
#
# This checkpoint doesn't call an LLM itself - like CP13's own comment says, see
# TALXIS/docs-patterns-practices (bdd-agent-v2) for that. It scaffolds the agent
# definition and the TestPlans/ convention so the workflow is: open this repo in an
# AI coding assistant that supports custom agents (GitHub Copilot agent mode, Claude
# Code, etc.), point it at .github/agents/bdd-warehouse-planner.agent.md, and give it a
# prompt such as "plan coverage for the low-stock highlight on the items grid."
#
# Run this once to scaffold the agent + TestPlans convention; run the agent itself as
# many times as you like afterwards, once per feature you want planned.
#
# Run:  .lab-scripts/CP16-plan-tests-with-agent.ps1

Add the planning step of the BDD-agent authoring chain: a prompt in, .feature files out, checked against the step-binding catalog the suite can already execute so proposed scenarios stay honest about what's implemented and what still needs binding work.

## Changes
- add .github/agents/bdd-warehouse-planner.agent.md — reads Support/Bindings + StepDefinitions before planning, explores the running app rather than guessing labels, reuses existing step text first, flags gaps instead of inventing bindings
- add TestPlans/ with README documenting the missing-bindings doc format
- add src/Tests.UI/Features/Planned/ as the landing spot for agent-planned scenarios pending review
## Testing
- no build changes; validate by running the agent against a scoped prompt and confirming it reuses existing step phrasing before proposing anything new
