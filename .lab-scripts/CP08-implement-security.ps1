# Least-privilege by design: a Security solution with two roles (Warehouse Manager and
# Warehouse Worker) granting scoped privileges over the warehouse tables.
#
# Privileges have a depth (Level), not just a type: Basic = own records, Local = own
# business unit, Deep = BU plus child BUs, Global = whole organization. The matrix is
# deliberate: a worker reads everything (Global) but edits only transactions they own
# (Write: Basic), while a manager gets full CRUD Globally. Model roles for personas, not
# individual people - and give automated test users a least-privileged role too, never
# an admin account.

Save-Checkpoint -Id "cp08" -Message "Add warehouse security roles and entity privileges" -Body @'
Define security boundaries for the warehouse app so workers and managers get the access they need. This checkpoint adds a dedicated security solution and the role privileges required for day-to-day operations.

## Changes
- add src/Solutions.Security to package security configuration as code
- create Warehouse worker and Warehouse manager security roles
- assign entity privileges for locations, items, and transactions
## Testing
- dotnet build --nologo --verbosity quiet passes after adding the security solution
