# Quality gate: a Reqnroll + Playwright BDD UI test project. We scaffold it and add a manual
# (workflow_dispatch) test workflow you can inspect — running it live needs a captured auth
# state (the capture steps are described in scaffold/11-tests-ui.ps1). The point here is
# the test project + workflow exist in source.
#
# BDD discipline in one paragraph: scenarios speak business language - Given sets context,
# When is one action, Then is an observable outcome, 3-5 steps total - so domain experts
# can read and challenge them. Selectors and waits belong in step definitions, never in the
# feature file. Two rules keep UI tests stable: prefer data-*/test-id selectors over
# display text (which breaks with localization), and never hard-sleep - wait for a
# specific element instead.
#
# UI tests are the top of the pyramid, not the whole pyramid: CP14 adds the fast layers
# underneath (FakeXrmEasy plugin tests and Jest script tests). See
# TALXIS/docs-patterns-practices (bdd-agent-v2) for AI agents that plan, bind and heal
# BDD tests.

Add browser-based regression coverage so key warehouse scenarios can be validated. This introduces the Playwright test project and a manual test workflow; running it live needs a captured Playwright auth state (see the scaffold script comments for the capture steps).

## Changes
- add src/Tests.UI with Reqnroll and Playwright test assets
- create sample warehouse navigation features (Items, Locations, Transactions) covering every sitemap area and view, plus a cross-area regression scenario, and appsettings.json
- add a Warehouse Picking feature covering the code app's picking flow (blocked over-pick,
  successful pick updates qty on hand), with hand-authored custom steps in StepDefinitions/
  since the frozen model-driven bindings can't navigate to a standalone SPA
- add .github/workflows/test.yml (manual workflow_dispatch) for the UI suite
## Testing
- dotnet build src/Tests.UI/Tests.UI.csproj passes and the PR workflow is ready to execute
