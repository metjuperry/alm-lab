# The UI solution: a model-driven app, sitemap navigation, forms, views and subgrids, plus
# form scripts, ribbon buttons and the TALXIS Grid PCF overlaid on the items subgrid
# (attached manifest-driven via `txc workspace control attach`, customized from Scripts.UI
# through the control's Client API). On top of that a Power Apps code app — a fully custom
# Vite + React SPA for warehouse picking — referenced straight into this same solution, so
# both UI styles ship from the same repo and the same package. This completes the inner
# loop — a working app from source. The Grid control package itself is imported into the
# environment by CP10, before the app package.
#
# Solutions.UI does not own the tables: it references them (Behavior=Existing) from
# Solutions.DataModel and only layers forms, views and commands on top. A reference carries
# just enough metadata to attach UI components without duplicating the schema, which keeps
# DataModel the single owner of every table definition.

Build the model-driven warehouse experience so users can navigate inventory data from a complete Dataverse app. This adds the app shell along with the core forms, views, scripts, and command surface, swaps the stock items subgrid for the TALXIS Grid PCF customized from our own script library through the control's Client API, and adds a code app for warehouse-floor picking — two UI styles for two personas, shipped from the same solution.

## Changes
- add src/Solutions.UI with the warehouse model-driven application
- configure sitemap navigation, entity forms, views, and subgrids
- add form scripts and ribbon commands for warehouse workflows
- attach talxis_TALXIS.PCF.Grid to the Warehouse Items subgrid via txc workspace control attach (group by category, sum of quantity, low-stock highlighting from Scripts.UI)
- add src/Apps.WarehousePicking, a Vite + React + TypeScript code app referenced directly into Solutions.UI
- register the three warehouse tables as code app data sources (typed models + services)
- implement the code app UI: items list, item detail with its transactions, a transactions list and a locations list (with per-location item counts), all querying Dataverse through the generated services; locations also resolve the item's location lookup
- add Node setup to the build workflow so the code app builds in CI
- add src/GenPages.Dashboard, a generative page (React + Fluent UI V9) showing inventory summary cards and a low-stock inventory table, referenced into Solutions.UI and surfaced as a Dashboard subarea in the sitemap
## Testing
- dotnet build --nologo --verbosity quiet passes with the UI, TALXIS Grid, and code app included
